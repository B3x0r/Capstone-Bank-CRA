# Capstone-Bank-CRA
This is a refactoring of Module 2 bank project that uses React, HTML, CSS, JS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB, and Heroku. This is my final project in my MITxPRO Professional Certificate in Coding.

Fork this and the Capstone-Bank-API projects to your computer. You will have to install MongoDB Compass and [I am forgetting what needs to be done here]. Once you are in the Capstone-Bank-API folder, use "npm start" in the terminal. Then, you can navigate to http://localhost:3000/account/all Now, you will go into the Bank-Capstone-CRA folder and run "npm start" in the terminal. You will then be able to navigate to the http://localhost:8080 to see the website.
 
#### Usage:
 
You will be able to create an account and keep track account info. You will also be able to withdraw and deposit into "your account".
 
#### Support: 
 
I would just check the website version if you can't get a cloned version to work.
 
#### Roadmap: 
I'd like the website to adjust to the screen size. I would like to add OAuth next, so users could choose to login with email or with a token. I would also add authorization, so only some users could access all of the data. Ultimately, I plan on developing it into an allowance tracker. Kids canâ€™t get their own login to a bank until they are 13, but kids younger than that might not want to store cash on hand. This would be a way for parents to track kids money without spending a monthly fee or an atm/debit card that could be lost.
